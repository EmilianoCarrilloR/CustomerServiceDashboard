# LiveAgent_TicketDataDump
The scripts in this repository create al ink to LiveAgent's API and download all ticket information for new, open, and resolved tickets. The script takes care of data curation issues such as multiple-address lines or quoted text.

Through simple PowerPivot- / PowerQuery-powered dashboards, one-stop-shop overviews like the ones below can be generated to share daily snapshots of a cusomer's service team performance including:
- Number of Open and New Tickets
- Response Speed Metrics
- Customer Contact Ageing Buckets Overview
- Classification and Density of Contact Reasons
- Solution Speed Metrics
